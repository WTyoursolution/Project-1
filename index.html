      The Shack (2017) is a faith-based drama film based on William P. Young's
      novel. The story follows Mack Phillips, a grieving father whose youngest
      daughter, Missy, is abducted and presumed murdered during a family camping
      trip. Struggling with despair and a crisis of faith, Mack receives an
      enigmatic invitation to return to the shack where evidence of his
      daughter's death was found.

      At the shack, Mack encounters three mysterious figures who represent God
      (Papa), Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Over the course of his stay, Mack
      embarks on a spiritual journey that challenges his beliefs, helps him
      confront his pain, and offers him healing and forgiveness. The film
      explores themes of faith, suffering, and the power of divine love in the
      midst of tragedy.
